# Software Engineering


## What is software engineering?

Software is a product of writing that is intended to direct a computational effort.

Engineering is the discipline of creating or improving systems such that they are reliable, scalable, maintainable, and performant.


## Requirements

Taking the title of software engineer implies that one has:
- Education pertinent to software development
- Experience in developing software
- Ethical action in performing engineering acts


## Non-Engineers

It is accurate to say that not all software developers are engineers.
People who produce software by rote or by implementing patterns of output based on pre-defined systems and frameworks are not necessarily "engineering" solutions.
This is akin to other fields: researchers discover a novel technology, engineers work out the implementation, and technicians do the work.
Each role is essential and requires a different make-up.


## Purpose of this document

To expore the idea of "software engineering" and codify its elements.
